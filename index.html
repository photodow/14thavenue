				<h1>We are merely a group of people trying to understand and practice <em>Godâ€™s inspired word</em>.</h1>
				<p class="h1">It is far too difficult for anyone to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by themselves. As a congregation, our goal is to encourage every member to build a relationship with God by listening to the <strong>words</strong> He has spoken in the Scriptures.</p>
