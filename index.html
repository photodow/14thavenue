				<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>We are just Christians–people who profess to follow Jesus Christ. We are not some “kind” of Christians or some particular denomination of people. We are merely a group of people who meet for bible study and worship on a regular basis in St. Petersburg and who are trying to do our best to understand God’s word and to practice it.</p>

				<p>Today’s world is a world of extreme denominational confusion. There are literally thousands of churches floating around, all claiming to be “Christians,” but often teaching conflicting or contradictory messages. In a society that is filled with such confusion, the pure simplicity of devotion to Christ often falls by the wayside.</p>

				<p>In such a religiously conflicted culture, people who are honestly seeking God with all their hearts will find difficulty. It is far too difficult for anyone to be a disciple of Jesus Christ by themselves. Perhaps this is why Jesus Himself charged His disciples to have love for one another. <em>“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another”</em> <strong>(John 13:34-35, NASU)</strong>.</p>

				<p>As disciples of Christ, we are doing our best to fulfill this charge that Christ gave us. One of our goals is for all men to know we are His disciples by the strength of the friendships and the love we have with one another.</p>

				<p>Our ultimate goal as Christians is to build a stronger relationship with God. He has already done so much to build that relationship with us first. The Scripture says, <em>“God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life”</em> <strong>(John 3:16)</strong>. As a congregation, our goal is to encourage every member to build that relationship with God by listening to the words He has spoken in the Scriptures.</p>

				<p>Because of our strong efforts to follow the words of God, it is imperative that we do our best to make sure that no man-made obstructions get in the way. Every single person is capable of reading and comprehending the Scriptures for his or herself. Someone does not need some kind of special ordination or enlightenment, nor do they need some kind of advanced degree in theology or language. The only thing anyone needs for understanding is to read the word of God, and to obey its teachings. Ezra the scribe once <em>“set his heart to study the law of the LORD and to practice it, and to teach His statutes and ordinances in Israel”</em> <strong>(Ezra 7:10)</strong>. At the congregation at 14th Avenue in St. Petersburg, we are setting our hearts to do these things as well.</p>
